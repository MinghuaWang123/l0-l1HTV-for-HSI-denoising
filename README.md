System-specific notes
---------------------
The code was tested in Matlab R2018b or higher versions on Windows 10 machines.

How to use it?
---------------------

Directly run simulated_indiancase6 to reproduce the results on the synthetic data, which exists in the aforementioned paper.  This code is used for HSI denoising uder noise case 6. 

If you want to run the code in your own data, you can accordingly change the input (e.g., data) and tune the parameters (important). 

If you encounter the bugs while using this code, please do not hesitate to contact us.
